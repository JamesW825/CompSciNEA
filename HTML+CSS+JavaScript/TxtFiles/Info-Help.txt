    1. A "defer" attribute in terms of a <script> tag, ensures that the script is executed after the HTML has been fully parsed.
    2. An `href="#"` attribute is often used in anchor (<a>) tags to create a hyperlink that doesn't navigate to a new page or location but instead performs some other action on the current page. The # symbol is commonly used as a placeholder for such links.
    3. A <span> tag is a generic container that is used to group inline elements and apply styles to a specific section of text. It is often used to style a specific part of the text without affecting the overall structure of the document.

    1. The backticks (`) are used to create a template literal. This allows you to embed expressions or variables within a string.
    2. The two URL components, `urlWithPrimaryApiKey` and `urlWithSecondaryApiKey`, are combined using string concatenation before making the API request. This ensures that both the `app_id` and `app_key` parameters are included in the API request, providing the necessary authentication for your application to access the TfL API.
    3. Removal of the parentheses() after `callTfLAPI` makes it so the function will be called when the button is clicked, not immediately when setting up the event listener.

    1. The `display` property in CSS is used to specify the rendering behavior of an element. It can take various values, each affecting the layout and presentation of the element in different ways.
    2. The `display: flex;` property is used to create a flex container. When applied to an element, it enables the flexbox layout for that element and its direct children. Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns.
    3. You can apply styles to forms (<form>) if they have an `id=""` attribute. To do this, you need to target that specific ID.

Part 4: Decipher API response, obtaining and displaying infromation that I require. 
    Eg: Status of selected line. 

Part 4.5: Get API to gather all line information. Have it be displayed in a menu that the user selects the line they wish to know about. 
    Eg: Like "TfL Go" does after clicking "Live status", only showing the lines that has isssues, then all other lines in "Good service" being as one part.
    To do this, do the equivalent of a for loop containg an if statement, to see if the API responce says/contains "Good service" to determine where the line goes.
