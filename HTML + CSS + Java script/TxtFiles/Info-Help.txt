This ensures that both the `app_id` and `app_key` parameters are included in the API request, providing the necessary authentication for your application to access the TfL API.

Part 4: Decipher API response, obtaining and displaying infromation that I require. 
    Eg: Status of selected line. 

Part 4.5: Get API to gather all line information. Have it be displayed in a menu that the user selects the line they wish to know about. 
    Eg: Like "TfL Go" does after clicking "Live status", only showing the lines that has isssues, then all other lines in "Good service" being as one part.
    To do this, do the equivalent of a for loop containg an if statement, to see if the API responce says/contains "Good service" to determine where the line goes.
